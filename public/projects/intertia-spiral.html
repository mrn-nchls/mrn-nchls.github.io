<h1>Inertia Spiral Design for Microalgae Focusing</h1>
<p>Interia spirals take advantage of the secondary flow that 
    occurs as a result of centripetal acceleration. This produces
    Dean Vortices and creates instability within the microchannel. 
    As a result, the particles are focused along the inner channel radius,
    where the equilibrium positions are located.</p>
